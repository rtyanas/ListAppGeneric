Simple application showing the functionalities:

- Tabs
- List of text and image
- Reading URL JSON data to use for list data
- Read image using URL in JSON data



Storing bitmaps in HashMap for ease of writing demo.  Should be stored to file in case of large image.

Issues:

	When no data is displayed upon starting, the background process is still working and will display data as delayed.
	Empty list items need to be removed.
	When starting the data sometimes takes time (sometimes longer than others) to appear.  The Text only tab sometimes does not display data.
	Images appear on Images Only tab but, won't appear on All tab until displayed on Images only tab.
	Not all images are displaying due to issues connnecting.
