Generic List application showing the functionalities:

- Tabs
- List of text and image
- Reading URL JSON data to use for list data
- Read image using URL stored in JSON data



Storing bitmaps in HashMap for ease of writing demo it should be stored to file in case of large image.

Issues:

	When no data is displayed upon starting, the background process is still working and will display data as delayed.
	When starting the data sometimes takes time (sometimes longer than others) to appear.  The Text only tab sometimes does not display data.
	Images appear on Images Only tab but, won't appear on All tab until displayed on Images only tab.
